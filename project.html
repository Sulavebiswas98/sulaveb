<p style="color:white;font-size:20px">1971 The War of Independence used the flag is determined on the basis of this flag, the red circle of the map was later moved to the flag, the map was dropped. The national flag of Bangladesh corresponds to the national flag of Japan , but the difference is that instead of greenhouses of Bangladesh, the Japanese use white. The red circle is slightly pressed on one side, when the flag flies, it should be seen in the middle of the flag.
On June 7 , 1970 , the students of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were to take part in a military parade in the Paltan Maidan of East Pakistan's capital Dhaka . For this purpose a ' Joy Bangla army' was organized with students , 'February 15 forces' were formed. The student leaders decided to build a flag of this force. To this end , 1970, on June 6, DU Sergeant Saheeh Hall (then Iqbal Hall), 116 (currently 117118) No. room BCL leader ASM Abdur Rab , Shahjahan Siraj , Kazi Aref Ahmed , Marshal Monirul Islam sat in a meeting with the plans of the flag. Chhatra League leader Swapan Kumar Chowdhury, Jagannath University (then Jagannath College) Nazrul Islam, general secretary of the district unit BCL, and central student leader Shivneri Das , general secretary of the university unit, Hasanul Haque Inu and student leader Yusuf Salahuddin Ahmed were present at the meeting.
At the end of the discussion, based on the initial proposal of Kazi Aref, the decision was taken to create a yellow-colored map of Bengal in the red sun on the green land. Kamrul Alam Khan (Khasru) then seized a circle of red in a big piece of green cloth from a Bihari garage shop in New Market; Then East Map of Pakistan marking on the tracing paper with map book from Enamul Haque of 312 of Qayed Azam Hall (now titumir hall) of Yusuf Salauddin Ahmed and Hasanul Huq Inu University of Engineering. Student leader Shivnarayan Das finally drew his map with red handed in red circle [3] [4] [5]
On March 2, 1971 , the first national flag was hoisted in the history of Bangladesh at Battala of Dhaka University . Abdur Rab . He was the Vice President of University of Dhaka University at that time . According to the CIA World Factbook [2] [7] green color of the country was used to mean the green nature of Bangladesh. [8]
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman hoisted the flag on March 23, at his residence on the eve of declaration of independence. Later, in 1972 , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's government asked Patua Kamrul Hasan to give a report containing the size, color and interpretation of the flag, except for the map between the designs of Shivnarayan Das . The revised form of Kamrul Hasan is currently the national flag of Bangladesh.</p>

<center><h1 style="font-size:60px;color:red;"><i>Capital of Bangladesh</i><h1></center>
<br><br>
<p  style="color:white;font-size:20px"> <img src="dkh.jpg" width="600" height="400" class="flag">Dhaka, also spelled Dacca, city and capital of Bangladesh. It is located just north of the Buriganga River,
 a channel of the Dhaleswari River, in the south-central part of the country. Dhaka is Bangladesh’s most populous city and is one of the largest metropolises in South Asia. Pop.
 (2001) city, 5,333,571; metro. area, 9,672,763; (2011) city, 7,033,075; metro. area,14,543,124</p>
<h1 style="color:red">HISTORY</h1>
<p  style="color:white;font-size:20px">Dhaka name is said to refer to the dhak tree, once common in the area, or to Dhakeshwari (“The Hidden Goddess”), whose shrine is located in the western part of the city. Although the city’s history can be traced to the 1st millennium CE,
 the city did not rise to prominence until the 17th century, when it served as the capital of the Muslim Mughal dynasty of Bengal province (1608–39 and 1660–1704). It was the centre of a flourishing sea trade, attracting English, French, Armenian, Portuguese, and Dutch traders.

Historic buildings of the Muslim period include Lal Bagh fort (1678) and its tomb of Bibi Pari (died 1684), wife of a governor of Bengal; the Bara Katra (great caravansary, a building historically used for sheltering caravans and other travelers; 1664);
 the Chhota Katra (small caravansary; 1663); and Husayni Dalan (a religious monument of the Shīʿite branch of Islam; 1642). Other 17th-century buildings include the Hindu Dhakeshwari temple and Tejgaon church, built by the Portuguese.

With the removal of the provincial capital to Murshidabad (1704) and the weakening of the muslin industry, Dhaka entered a period of decline. It passed under British control in 1765 and was constituted a municipality in 1864,
 but it continued to lose prominence until it was designated the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam province (1905–12). During the early 20th century Dhaka served as a commercial centre and seat of learning. Following the end of British rule, when the region became a part of Pakistan, it was named the capital of East Bengal province (1947) and of East Pakistan (1956). Dhaka suffered heavy damage during the war of independence in 1971 but emerged as the capital of Bangladesh.
